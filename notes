Bug:
Game doesnt set starting player based on colour of spare card
    Though because who gets what colour is still randomised it note a huge deal
    But does make it differ from real Game
Need to implement "pass" move, (use GameState.isPassAvailable)

Todo:
Fix the bug^^ so games don't blow up anymore
create some tests for stasitical signifiacne of results

Apprently it's not possible to draw in onitama? Said random dude on forum

Analysis:
make "unsafe" move function which doesnt check inputs
    This will be way faster for using in simulated games
Minmax-notebook:
    Chart to show pruning version is more efficent (from then on, dont ever have to use naive version)
    Do significance test on pruning to see if extra depth helps
    (assuming it doesnt)
        Remove "pwn" points and see how that changes results
        Shuffle moves (when choices are even), see what effect that has
    Bonus: timing analss of why long outlier tail?
Montecarlo tree search

Number of states:
25P4 * 21P4 * 17P1 * 16P1 = 1.19*10^13 (10 trillion)
card comibations  (for a specific game) = 5 = insignficat
times another few 10^11 for combinations with 3 pawns, etc
puts us in 10^24+ range at least
